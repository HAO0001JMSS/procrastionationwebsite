        <h3>What is your chosen infographic topic and why is this a topic you wish to research?</h3>
        <p>Procrastination has become a prominent issue for the student population at JMSS, as it can<br>
        heavily affect academic performance, to the point where students are unable to complete tasks<br>
        to the expected standard, causing problems in their future and career. This topic was chosen<br>
        so students can better understand how prevalent the issue is, and to propose potential solutions<br>
        for readers having the problem, while also informing the audience on the scientific findings regarding procrastination.</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose of the infographic website - Persuade, Inform or Entertain? What does it aim to achieve?</h3>
        <p>The infographic website will inform readers about what procrastination is and how it affects<br>
        academic performance and wellbeing. Accurate, scientific information about alleviating or<br>
        avoiding procrastination will be provided so students can better understand how to reduce<br>
        procrastination in their lives. Statistics about procrastination which were collected from<br>
        students in the school will also show readers that procrastination is an issue that many students<br>
        experience, and that they aren't alone.</p>

        <h3>Intended audience - Describe the type of students this infographic is targeted towards and why, eg age group, ethnicity, gender, interests, etc</h3>
        <p>The intended audience are students between the ages of 15 to 18 studying in Victoria. We<br>
        selected this age group as these students will begin or are currently enrolled into VCE<br>
        classes, which can be very stressful, likely causing them to have a higher chance of feeling<br>
        the effects of procrastination firsthand.</p>

        <h3>What information based on primary data are you aiming to collect and present on your infographic?</h3>
        <p>The information we plan to collect includes:<br><br>

            - An estimated amount of procrastination within students on a weekly basis<br>
            - Preferred forms of procrastination<br>
            - Extracurriculars and how much time is spent on a weekly basis on them<br>
            - If students believe that procrastination affects their academic performance<br>
            - Subject choices<br><br>

            Each of these questions will be separated by year level, as it is likely that the level of<br>
            procrastination differs between year levels. Overall, the collection of this data will enable<br>
            us to make an understanding of how the intended audience experiences procrastination, and what<br>
            characteristics of a student can contribute to procrastination.</p>

        <h3>What information based on secondary data are you aiming to research and present on your website?</h3>
        <p>The information our group will research that is based on secondary data is the science behind<br>
            procrastination and effective ways to prevent it, along with strategies to help students avoid
            procrastination in our lives.</p>

        <h3>What will you do to ensure the integrity of your primary and secondary data (i.e reliable and free from bias)?</h3>
        <p>In the case of primary data, we will ensure all work has been collected fairly with no bias.<br>
        This is done through having a high population of people that data is collected from. Further<br>
        questions will be asked to minimise possible risks of a faulty experiment, such as “any<br>
        extracurriculars outside of school”, as it may decrease the chances of procrastination, since<br>
        they may be more motivated to study. Another question will be, “what year level are you in this<br>
        year”, as some year levels may not have to put in as much effort to study as others.<br><br>

            Therefore each person will fall into two categories based on their year level and their extracurriculars. For each person there will be the question:<br>
            -  How much work did you want to get done?<br>
            -  How much did you get done?<br>
            -  What was your way of procrastination?<br> 
            -  Have you tried to do anything to stop it?<br>
            -  If so, what have you done?<br>
            -  Has it worked?<br><br>
            
            With secondary data, we will ensure all outside data collected was from credible sources,<br>
            which will be done by checking the APA hyperlinks of websites and do external research if<br>
            many credited websites source similar information.</p>

        <h3>What will you do to ensure the ethical collection, storage and use of collected data?</h3>
        <p>Regarding the ethical processes behind the collection of the data, as a group, we will make<br>
        sure to not ask any personal questions or anything relating to the academic results of participants<br>
        that may cause discomfort. This will enable the data collection to remain neutral and unbiased.<br>
        Personal opinions will not interfere with the data collection and will be submitted purely based on<br>
        participant results. As an essential process, we will ask consent before the commencement of the data collection.<br><br> 

        We will store all data on an usb to prevent it from being sent to outsiders, and set precautions such<br>
        as encrypted files for full protection against the data. Moreover, a google form will be sent out to<br>
        students. Those who complete the survey filled with our questions based on procrastination will give us<br>
        our primary data. This form will remain anonymous, and we will not know the name of the student to prevent<br>
        any leakage of data. The most obvious way to ensure full protection is to not share the data with anyone outside the group.</p>
