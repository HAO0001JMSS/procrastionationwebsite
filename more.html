        <h3>(only for those really interested in procrastination!!)</h3>
        <p>Procrastination, like all things to do with humans, starts with our brains.<br>
        According to Ness Labs, procrastination is caused by the limbic system overriding<br>
        our prefrontal cortex. The limbic system, more commonly known as the paleomammalian<br>
        brain, is one of the oldest and most dominant parts of the brain, responsible for<br>
        deciding your emotions and instinctual decisions to stimuli, such as the fight or<br>
        flight response. This was valuable for prehistoric humans, as short-term decisions<br>
        to escape from danger were valuable. However the limbic system doesn't consider the<br>
        long term. This is where our prefrontal cortex comes in, as the prefrontal cortex is<br>
        responsible for complex behaviour and making long term decisions. However due to being<br>
        a newer part of the brain, it is less dominant compared to the limbic system and as such<br>
        decisions which benefit you in the short term is the decision you are more likely to make<br>
        due to the limbic system overriding other parts of the brain especially the prefrontal<br>
        cortex, which leads to procrastination.<br><br></p>
        <img src="images/pcycle.png">
        <p>So to stop procrastination, we need to understand how our brain reacts to<br>
        tasks, both emotionally and habitually. According to Harvard Business Review,<br>
        procrastination is caused by 3 main factors.<br><br>
        1. Poor discipline, arising from bad habits<br>
        2. Intolerance of negative emotions we think will occur due to doing the work, such as anxiety and boredom<br>
        3. Common brain patterns, such as underestimating/overestimating the amount of work needed to complete a task, and cognitive blocks<br><br>

        Fixing these cognitive problems in our lives can significantly improve the amount<br>
        of work we can get done, and therefore make us feel more productive and therefore<br>
        more accomplished and happy.<br><br>
    
        There is lots of advice on how to avoid procrastination on the internet, but the<br>
        predominant theme in all advice is about forming consistency, or a habit. As if you<br>
        just avoid procrastination for a week, and then become lax and go back to your old<br>
        behaviour, nothing will change. As such, forming a habit to prevent wanting to<br>
        back to procrastination.<br><br>
    
        According to a study done, on average it takes 66 days for a behaviour to become<br>
        automatic, i.e. it takes 66 days to form a habit. So our goal should be to replace<br>
        our procrastination habit with a working habit. This is quite a challenging goal, as<br>
        to wean oneself off procrastination we need to change how we perceive work, something<br>
        which is nearly always a challenge and brings negative emotions and/or a lack of positive emotions.<br><br>
    
        Some ways to start working your way through procrastination can be breaking down your large<br>
        objectives into smaller, easier goals, starting off with the easier parts of the project to<br>
        get into the rhythm of work, and clear possible distractions. The following video summarises<br>
        these concepts well.</p>

    <p>We are a group of students studying Computing Units 1/2 wanting to find out more about procrastination, more specifically its effects<br>
    and consequences. We were interested in this topic as it is a very common issue amongst students our age.</p>
