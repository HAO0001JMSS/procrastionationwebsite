    <h1>Procrastination at JMSS</h1>
    <p>Procrastination is the act of delaying an important task… I'm going to finish writing this later…<br><br>
        No! That's procrastination! Putting off something important and choosing to do something more<br>
        enjoyable instead! In this case, not writing this introduction will cause me to miss the deadline<br>
        for this assignment!<br><br>

        Procrastination is a widespread problem, especially in high school, where students will leave any task, even<br>
        important ones assignments and study to the last minute, which can have a serious impact on grades and academic<br>
        performance, as found in data collected through surveying students ranging from year 10 to year 12 at JMSS.<br><br>

        As such, we designed this website to inform you on exactly how procrastination affects students, how students<br>
        begin and end their procrastination episodes, and how best to avoid procrastination in the future.
