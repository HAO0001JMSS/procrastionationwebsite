            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <h4><br>What did the research reveal?</h4>
            <p>The research revealed that procrastination is commonplace at JMSS. It was<br>
            found that Year 11s and 12s are more likely to procrastinate for longer,<br>
            however the difference between all three year levels is minimal.<br></p>
            <h4>Did the results meet your group's expectations?</h4>
            <p>The results did meet our expectations to an extent in terms of the average<br>
            length of time students procrastinate (for around 30 minutes in 2 hours), ways<br>
            students procrastinate (technology and social media), and how procrastination<br>
            affects academic results (From a little ranging to quite a lot) were all expected. However<br>
            it was expected that there would be a larger correlation between extra-curriculars,<br>
            and those doing accelerated study with increased procrastination. This did not end<br>
            up being the case as no correlation was found.<br></p>
            <h4>Anything interesting or unusual?</h4>
            <p>Procrastination was not directly related to what year level a participant was in<br>
            nor was it related to their extracurricular activities; what was interesting about<br>
            this was that no factor was correlated with whether a participant had experienced<br>
            procrastination. The most popular method of procrastination was watching YouTube, the<br>
            second being messaging friends and the third being social media; from this it can be<br>
            deduced that the internet and technology is a major cause of procrastination among JMSS<br>
            students, specifically social media as the top 3 methods of procrastination are all forms of social media.<br><br></p>
